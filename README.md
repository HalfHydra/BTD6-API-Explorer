# BTD6 API Explorer

A site that can automatically track your progress and explore events + user generated content using the Ninja Kiwi Open Data API. Serves as a nice frontend for the information available on the API.

## How to Access

I host a copy of this site on [BTD6APIExplorer.github.io](BTD6APIExplorer.github.io)!
